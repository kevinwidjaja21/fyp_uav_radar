This is the source code for my Final Year Project which is about Collision avoidance on UAV using the Texas Instrument IWR1443 Radar. Runs on ROS. Most of the code is a modified version of the TurtlBot example from the TI Resource website. Hence, I have every package required to run, including the TurtleBot package. This package might be redundant and can be removed. Otherwise, you will only need MAVROS and MAVlink packages first. Copy the contents of the repository to you /src folder inside your catkin work folder. Sorry, not quite familiar with GitHub.
